# FlyDatabases

Setting up different databases on fly.io, which is particularly awesome because of the private networking between regions (so you don't have to publicly expose or setup a ton of VPC peering connections).

Yes I revoke my API keys after I commit :)

I really with they had better automation for this. The machines API is very low level, and causes a ton of repetition.

Their apps v2 is too high level for this.

Their terraform provider is not well-supported enough.
